I am just going to be blunt here: The main characters suck. The main protagonists, a brother and a sister, are depthless and one dimensional. The sister literally spends 90% of her lines crying or shouting for someone to save her. The brother is arrogant and apparently a "genius", yet seems to have no redeeming qualities. Overall, the story and CGI are decent, but the characters leave much to be desired.

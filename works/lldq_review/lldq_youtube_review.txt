Enjoy the trailer for the Chinese sci-fi box-office smash hit THE WANDERING EARTH!

From the Chinese is perspective, the world works together. From the American is perspective, only Americans are capable of saving the world.

Netflix buying this movie brought me here

Ok China. i am up for this. Show me you can beat Hollywood

I too would like to fire a Gatling gun at Jupiter 😂

watched movie today, INCREDIBLE!!!! It is a human epic!!!! Not just Chinese is hero,  Japanese is hero, Korean is hero , American is hero,everyone is hero, this is a story about whole human survived themselves.

I have never seen the night. I have never seen the stars. I have never seen spring, fall or winter. I was born as the Braking Era ended, just as the Earth stopped turning. It had taken forty-two years to halt the Earth is rotation, three years longer than the Coalition had planned. My mother told me about the time our family watched the last sunset. The Sun sank very slowly as if stuck on the horizon. It took three days and three nights to finally set. Of course, afterward, there was no more 'day' or 'night'. The Eastern hemisphere was shrouded in perpetual dusk for a long time, maybe a decade or so. The Sun lay just below the horizon, its glow filling half the sky.  During that endless sunset, I was born.

Director: How many nations do you want? China: Yes

Great quality not just for a China film, but any international film

Netflix should play the director version that is 45 minutes longer than current theater version.

I just watched it and I give it a 7/10, correction 7.5, correction 8, correction 8.5, correction, correction, correction 9.5/10 . This may be the best SciFi movie of the year. Good Job China from Emirates 💓

Gorgeous,large-scale and very realistic...congratulations to the filmmakers from China.Amazing movie...best regards from Russia.

Just finished watching this and as an asian who is not chinese I recommend this movie!!

China: "Let is work together to save the world!" Mer'ca: "Hold my beer."

Best movie i have watched in 2019 till date... Chinese are awesome...

10/10 if you like sci-fi, THIS is the movie you were looking for, for a long time

IS THIS THING COMMING TO EUROPE OR NOT?? Jesus i want to see this in cinema 😣

OMG this is the prettiest movie. I saw it a couple days ago... imagine if the Interstellar animators were on acid, in the most beautiful way possible. Also gotta appreciate that it is a movie about cooperation, where no single character is sacrifices or single country is effort saves the world. It is not about a single hero is journey; it is about a single species' journey.

Shit, got goosebumps while watching this trailer. i am looking forward to this movie.

I watched it today.  It was damn awesome👏✊👍.  I still want to watch it again in english dub. Hats off from India🇮🇳

sick of Hollywood Story that one American saved earth every time... this film shows that all countries are trying and many did it before the Chinese. victory is due to the United of all Mankind...

Watched this last night. Amazing! Great movie!

Plot of the movie: Earth: Do not worry guys I have a plan! Earth has left the game

loving it. China is growing cultural assets at a wonderful pace!!! 很開心! 很感到驕傲!!! 中國加油!!!!!! 祖國加油!!!!!

Just saw this at a Cinemark theatre, at first I was like WTF!!! Why are they speaking in Chinese, but then those graphics and the story grabbed me!! IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!

My goodness, I almost cried during the second trailer.

This must be what it is like for foreigners to watch a box office film made in America.

tbh I really enjoyed this movie and I feel like the people complaining about chinese nationalism are being idiots because IT is A CHINESE MOVIE, THE MAIN PROTAGS ARE BOUND TO BE CHINESE, and imo they included a bunch of actors of other nationalities which is pretty damn good already, but i am chinese so I guess I have no right to an opinion

I was looking for a wandering Jew rather end up here.

Luckily I speak both English and Chinese

Now I am looking forward to watching The Three Body Problem triology.

Thanks for bringing Sulawesi into the movie. The girl looks like Leony Vitria.

Is this based on a true story?

Woww did not see that coming. It is really superb. Waiting for the movie

why cant u all just sit and enjoy the trailer instead of being TOXIC in comment

Best chinese sci fi movie ever!!👍

Just watched the movie. It’s very good!

this looks amazing!  I feel like there is an undercurrent of HOPE despite the impending disaster....something we all could use right now.  I hope Chinese film encourages this over the doom and gloom we have here in Hollywood.

Without any doubt, the best sci-fi writer in the world Cixin Liu and his best movie in the world, the wandering earth. I have watched three times...

This was one of the best end of days movies I have ever watched. Please make many many many more 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥

Sci Fi  still using bullets in the future. Massive fail.

I just watched this movie. China, great job!! 👍🏻 love from 🇺🇸

Through some website, I have been begging Hollywood many years ago to do such a movie or even a TV series where the earth is wandering through space in search of another suitable solar system. Ah well! at least this one proves to be a huge success internationally.

Let is take a moment to acknowledge the guy who was shooting Jupiter with a minigun.

i watched this at the movie theater and literally me and a girl sitting in the back were screaming in tears at the last part when.. SPOIL ALERT when the dad dies and sacrifices him self to save earth btw i speak chinese and english and french and korean :)

Best scene shoots at Jupiter with minigun

Excelent movie, cn make really good movies, probably best world ending movie.

Who thought its a good idea to put crucial earth engine on one of the most active volcano and earthquake active region on earth, indonesia?

There you go China!! Intense, stunning & visually epic..👌🏾

I cried when I watched this movie it’s sad

"Interstellar left the group"

Aweeeeeeeeesooomeee moviee. I hope they make more movies like this

this is the first sci-fi movie that quote every details about what is going on along it, simple, accurate and all.  easy to understand almost like a documentary but enough entertaining and convincing you  these people are into serious sh*t there.  the comedy is always at the right moment into the scenes.

Great trailer. More than half the comments are about world politics instead of about a fictional movie

This is amazing cant wait for more like this from China!

3:01 - `SULAWESI` is the name of island in `Indonesia` :)

Let is go China  Love from Earth

Read the book and i am really excited to see that Netflix took it! Amazing by the looks of it!

China showed me real great chaina content finally! i am very impressed as one of SF fan boy.

Just finished watching this. Movies like this are the reason I do not watch American movies anymore =)

Holy shit this actually looks amazing.

I just wanna know when it will be available on Netflix :v

One Of My Favorite Sci-fi Movie Amazing Movie Every Nation Helped To Save Our Planet

I hope it will be in Indonesia Cinema.

Independence Day movie: world leaders rejoice, "the Americans have a plan!" This is no different. So, stop complaining that it is Chinese. Looks like a well-made movie. Sometimes you have to enjoy things for their own being and not paint it with your personalized brush strokes.

00:04 « dulud !! » its song like a parody 😂

I just watched it with many friends today in the theater. Honestly, It is amazing and i am really touched! We all would like to watch it again on Netflix.

KOONGEE FAT AH THAI 2019! It Is, The Way Of The Wandering Earth! 😎

It’s 2019 why the subs

looks pretty epic, I will definitely have to check this one out then

god i love this reminds me of that scifi book nomad where the earth got slingshot and became a rogue planet bec a black whole passed by our solar system.

Had me in tears!!!

So its armagheddon but the chinese version made in 2019, okay...

Looks good, I missed the release of this hope I can see it in UK

Hollywood: I"m going to make a movie China: hold my beer

i am soo hyped. This is some Interstellar/Sunshine mixed sci/fi porn. I love it.

bruh it is been a while since i saw a chinese film, i am so happy theyve gotten way better i would pay to see this, it goes toe to toe with american and korean films.

This is like Gravity meets 2012.

If doomsday happened, America will build ships to leave, but China will carry the entire earth...

I want my 2 hours back

Finally movie where earth ppl save earth and not only one single country

I love this film!  one of the best everytime! thanks china and neflix.  great. lg switzerland

Philippines proud too in this movie 😍 there is a filipino in this movie and speak own language 😊

You know, this actually looks good. i am going to watch it!

Looks cool! PS: Tony’s chocolonelyは最高です。

I dont know anything about this movie but the visuals look amazing!

This could be an anime or something even if it’s Chinese

Show my respect to Chinese movie worker! They have done a GREAT JOB !

THIS IS THE KIND OF MOVIE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR....... I WOULD LOVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. ❤

Happy I found this, looks dope

That. Looks. Freaking. Awesome!

We should just take the earth and move it- Patrick star

0:03 why is this funny as hell lmao

I just watched the movie.  And just 1 word: AMAZING

Looks action packed the sort of movie that would appear in Rick & Morty is interdimensional tv

The funny thing is, there is always people uploading the full movie of <the wandering earth> on YouTube.

Now this is what you call a Sci-Fi movie, I watched it today. Mankind in the brink of extinction, Mankind unites, Mankind saves humanity, Mankind survives. P.S.: anyone here watched the episode of 'Invader Zim' Battle of the Planets. it is somewhat similar to this movie, because of the thrusters of the Planet Earth.

Okay, China, you got my attention.

Freezing Earth, hardcore sci-fi and the Chinese everywhere - exactly how I imagine the future.

Should name the movie "Correction"

I saw it and the best parts were in the trailer...

cool movie, I heard there was a 'Director cut version' with the whole story, how to get it.

i am proud of humanity and our Earth.

Good movie, I already watching full movie...

i watched it and its AMAZING im not gonna spoil it just watch it

Love this movie ❤❤❤

Just finished watching. Damn this movie is really good!

This movie is so good!

great. movie. full of action. lost half of it reading the subs:D

I would imagine building a counterfeit Earth as replacement.

watched it on Netflix.  I have to say, the special effects were ok, but still lags behind Hollywood production, especially the physics look more like an animation than real.

Goodbye ... solar system ... 🌏💨

That HAL moment -- echoes of 2001...

They forgot to add the chilli is :(

yes, this is based on a true story~~

Wish it will show here in my country Philippines

One of the best movie I have seen this yr. Great movie even though i had to read the subtitles.

I watched this yesterday. Its a collection of scenes copied from every sci fi movie from the passed 20 years. What a rip off.

Netflix just bought this film. Oh man! I cant wait to see it!!!

The World Engine remind me the Shadow Raiders.

I think, this movie should have released worldwide.

Pretty much showed the entire movie lol

Legit cannot wait to see this... 🚀☄🔥

ar u fear with Doom? yeah me to

Eagerly waiting for india release👍 Love from india

wow even the trailer look so good

Looks awesome tho, cgi and everything looks great

correction!  correction!  correction!  correction!  correction!  correction!  correct... corr... co.. congratulations. i mean... correcttion!

1:41 ... Really?

The first trailer made me tear up

When arsemericunts make science-fiction films, they dont protest n dont blaspheme. But when china made science-fiction films, they blasphemed n sneered. Ahh.. non-chinese Peace ✌

Theme of the century - MASS Migration of cosmic proportion !!

i know chinese since i am, i understand wut their saying, but i read the english captions anyway

Ng Man Tat is in this movie. In a serious role. I really want to see this now.

"We should take the Earth, and push it somewhere else!"

Ought to read the novel. Brilliantly amazing..!!!

They have done a good job with this.

I just saw this movie today. Absolutely  awesome. Incredible suspense, cool take on survival.

SULAWESI island found at 4:26"

Looking forward to this, and hoping soon "The Three Body Problem" will get made. (An amazing trilogy)

The best movie that nobody talks about !

this really looks interesting

To pull this off even in sci-fi... i am assuming the West has declined to a state to let PRC lead the way in space tech.

It is not about usa or china or any..It is about the unity of mankind to save the world

can I see it in American Theaters Ohhhh wait even better I just read NetFlix just snatched it up HElll Yeah..

went to watched today, it was pretty good, i give like 4.3 out of 5

Really looking forward to watching this!! Looks totally stunning!! Hope they do Three Body Problem next.

holy f its so amazing, thanks netflix for buying this

This is one of the memories from "Shelter" Official music video... The part when the earth collided with Jupiter kind like rogue planet!!

Amazing this trailler, I loved the special effects! I look forward to seeing this movie here in Brazil. Chinese movies are great, and quality is not far from American movies! Congratulations China !!!

I adore how the Americans are coming here with all their butts on fire jocking about how absurd China saving the world is, considering that each and every american film I watched they always saved us all even from cosmic farts, with their guns first and terrible punchlines.  Looking forward to see a different take on this theme.

1:23:39 of the whole film. Nang iwan ang mga pinoy😞. I just hope na kasama cla sa bumalik.

Oh my God. Sulawesi ID is there😍😍

i love science fictions like this

The dialogue looks dreadful (maybe rough translations) but I will still watch it for the special effects.  Looks cool.

Judging by the comments this is a must watch. Ok Netflix, you got my attention.

Do I have to wear this mask while I watch?

Wow, it is a very good Chinese movie. The teacher opened me to see it very sad.

Netflix just bought it

I know now why they said it is an anime. 😁

Looks awesome! 32 JoBlo Movie Trailers 回复 RR METALBOX RR METALBOX 2周

Just watched this movie, its probably one of better sci-fic movie i have watched for the past few years. This is either equivalent or better than most Hollywood films.

Like, wow, man; awesome. 😎

Looks really really good... high production values.. interesting story line... good work !

i would love kind this movie awesome

Was there another asian movie that looked like a bad ass action movie? I remember seeing some trailer last year or so and the trailer looked awesome. Never mind. Found it. it was Warriors of the Future

anjirlah bumi di dorong pakek mesin wkwkwk

Oh my God. This script made it to production?  Jupiter ain’t nearby folks!

Dam this looks really good!

Got a book with the short story in, maybe ought to read it, hmm. Terrific writer , have read other novels by same author... heavy stuff.

This trailer had me until a guy started shooting at a planet.

saw it and it was sooooooooooo bad

dvd is already avail for free on streaming sites.

Earth turns to spaceship... Planetship

Is this a trailer or the whole movie 🤔

My first subscription This Year. You deserve it for giving me a good trailer while I await film download from fmovies

I like when the guy yells "Screw you" and fires a minigun up into the sky at the planet Jupiter.

No words for this movie.. just unexplainable fabulous.........❣😍

I cant wait to see this movie when it comes to Netflix.  Looks awesome.

Hopefully this get English dub so I can watch it.

Kapan tayang di Indo? 😭

who here from spacedock?

Im sold, cant wait to watch this.

Wow, this look really well done. I need to se this one. Looks very Hollywood. Good that you mixed up with some english it will be tirering to listening to only chinese. Hope i can find a good transelation to english.

am definitely watching this, chinese are good with action films and the trailer is awesooome

I guess we are all looking for a way to throw our lives away on a meaningful and hopeless cause.

i love This movie. i learned a lot watching it .it improved my ideas as well.  and i have great love and respect for all Chinese people.  Such a wonderful movie ... Chinese have the ability to make much much better sci-fi films than other industries. Come on make more

in the story of the film, is the CCP still in full power? ^^

Almost $700m with only 50m budget.. woooww..amazing box office hit, that is why some americans now angry here

If any of you are wondering this movie is already out in China and is pretty good overall 31 JoBlo Movie Trailers 回复 查看 4 条回复  Peter Ippel Peter Ippel 5 个月

1:01 Red Alert 2 intro movie

Look very interesting ..cant wait to see it soon !

Even if we could build giant thrusters to move the earth, they would just blow the atmosphere off the earth and we would all suffocate.

I don’t know why but I though the kid on the right of the thumbnail was Jaden Smith. 🤣

0:03 Lol wtf was that sound?

I see sulawesi 3:01

This movie is so amazing, but like many other good movies, it would be much better if it had not come with the so-called 3D effects

Saw the box office and needed to check it out. This looks suprisingly good. I think I will check it out, the hype and wait for Captain Marvel make me wanna see another movie before and this looks to fit that bill nicely.

Hmm, interesting and unique concept,  outstanding visuals, this looks like a Chinese movie I want to see!

damn i cried everytime the movie showes how human unite together to save the earth

Those 12 seconds on the countdown simply break the immersion. 12 seconds... That was too much. Correction, correction, correction...

People ❗️ this is a fictional drama, everyone get off your high horse and give some credit here. I don’t care about your expertise of our planets and atmosphere, I loved it 👏👏 full of anticipation, excitement, suspense, sensational scenes and good acting. Even had me in tears during tragic loss of lives. Some people are not able to step out of the box and use your imagination 🤷🏻‍♀️ So forgive me for my enthusiasm towards a film that gave me enjoyment. ❌⭕️❌⭕️

This looks so good

You cant move the earth from the solar system! This is stupidity

Dude Jupiter is huge When earth abandoned the solar  system

Must watch for any scifi aficionados. Very fresh in a sea of  the same old tropes and remakes.

When will this be on Netflix?

i am seeing it

👍🏽🔥👍🏽🔥

The trailer basically shows everything thats going to happen. It even showed the most climatic parts.

after watched this movie..i am grateful to almighty allah who control all this planets...almighty allah only savior...

Wacincongcincong hhe :v

It was quite nice movie I enjoy it a lot... Thank you.

This is a great story, starring the famous Chinese actor Wu Jing  ;))

Wow. Sulawesi ia one of land in Indonesia. Proud of it!

"Sunshine", 2017, same plot?

This looks really good. Sci-Fi to my taste!

Make a change form having the yanks 'save' the day. Plus in a Chinese movie you will not have a Mary Sue or have a Wammin in charge.

"Space 1999" much?

This film contains all space movie clichés but looks hella amazing!

Ok now i can watch this this weekend..hope its as good as it looks..

It is still on cinemas if you live in USA or Canada or HongKong.

4:25 Sulawesi?

I saw this is a sacrifice. The 100 generations gave up the sun and lived underground. Only for the children after 2000 can see the sun.

Leave it to the Chinese.  They got that jedi wisdom

It is a pretty dark movie that was hidden by focusing on the main characters. When the world government said the project failed, the underground cities would have fallen into violent anarchy

This is one long trailer..subtitles..darn

america: oh no! china beats us

Worth watching multiple times

This so freaking good cant wait wish it was coming to the usa movie theaters. Anyone watched it yet?

Amazing china from Thailand.

watching right now. amazing movie. frm philippines

i download 8gb 4k reso..then my phone cannot handle 4k😭

It is a great movie with a very interesting concept. I watched it dubbed in English because I am a philistine and have no class.

Well, of all places, there is a showing near me. I will have to check this out. It looks pretty good.

1:40 reminds me Excel Saga when the mayor shot against the falling Gundam colony

Wonderful Movie !! i really enjoyed it , and the Jupiter absorbing Earth atmosphere Scene,was Amazingly Done !

Anyone know when this movie coming to Netflix?

Best movie for a longtime!!!!!!! Love from England UK

It is so awesome...it reminds me of the game LOST PLANET.

I watched in Netflix to understand..

1:40 Yes, that is a man shooting at Jupiter.

It is actually Home (2015)

I feel as if there should have been different reactions to many of the scenes based on the fact it is a lot of time has passed in doomsday scenario. There is also the implication of a society and culture based around it, so it seems really unusual with how many of the scenes play out.

Please dub in Urdu/hindi language..!

OMG Its good movie

Welp, Chinterstellar here we go again!

Netflix buying foreign movies is the reason my subscription cost keeps going up.

WAW that locks great well done....hope the story have a strong foundation cause, all American movies have the best FX but weak stories

meh is ok.... same Armageddon ending!!!

I was hoping they would dub-in an English dialogue track and I could watch it with the actor is lips moving out of sync with the words being spoken. 😂

Wow, the engine has name Sulawesi?? That is Cool. 😎 4:26

damn looks good

first step of de movie industrial monopoly from Hollywood！

Looks awesome!  Netflix bought rights.  Cant wait to watch it.

Dam, they are super duper fast and precise at saluting. It stinks of China new empire propaganda...

looks amazing

where can i download this ?

Courtesy Aliexpress, Gearbest, Huawey and you name it, in the name of those damaged by those copying aces in China !

I am watching it right now..  BTW you can also watch it on Netflix 😀

that trailer was terrible.. i dont even need to watch the movie now, the trailer showed me everything.

Like watching a Hollywood film but dubbed in Chinese..  Cant wait for ds one though.

i noticed 5 min trailer , now i dont wanna watch this. thanks

looks delicious!

2044earyh got engine😂😥

i watch this on neflix

3.01 minute. Sulawesi. wkwkland mana suaranya ????

Did not really get the first trailer; the 2nd and international trailer definitely got me interested with that appeal to emotion.

This looks fantastic!

Being an INDIAN i  would say this movie is FANTASTIC and has a quality...i have enjoyed it.....and i would recommend everybody to watch this....I could really see the effort of Chinese film industry...EXCELLENT & keep up.

I watched this movie. SPOILER ALERT 🚨  When his dad died I started crying so hard.

yg di thumbnails gw kira si UUS

I wrote 2012 my book "Caluclation ERROR", where I wrote in the last part about civilization levels. Level 2: moving around planets - this is from now to the end of main sequence of our  sun in 5 billion years Level 3: Surviving wild changes of the sun - this is to move Earth far enough away to survive the sun as a red giant. My daughter Johanna wrote just an scientific work about moving Earth the next 5 billion years, when our suns power output doubles based on current and near future technology. Never thought, an action film could be made from this theme.

unfortunately, cannot even go to the moon now even with the technology today

10/10☺️

Awesome cgi 👏👏👏

Directing & fast cuts could have been better. Painful to watch at times.

.this will not have much pull in western culture.

Earth is in danger. Bring the earth and go live another place!

ça a l'air cool je crois que Netflix ont acheter les droits de diffusion

Hey do you live around here

The plot is pretty facepalm worthy as far as sci fi concepts go. So its all built around the sun turning into a red giant (which is still several BILLION years away) but let is ignore that part for now. So the plan is to move the entire damn planet to another solar system.  First of all, any civilization with the tech to do that could just move their own asses to another planet and terraform it, which would require far less resources, not to mention that sending the damn planet between stars would make it so utterly uninhabitable that it would need to be terraformed from scratch anyway when it finally arrived.  Secondly, if they do have the ability to just haul the damn planet wherever they please and do it in a way that will not instantly kill everyone on it (underground cities or not, you stop it from spinning fast enough and you will have a population of pancakes), they could simply move the damn thing into the new habitability zone of the red giant instead, it would still fuck shit up in a major way but you would not need to completely start over on a barren rock either + once the initial expansion is done the star will be stable for thousands or even millions of years, which would provide more than enough time to find a less crappy solar system. ^^

Great movie! Chinese people are truly talented!

I smell a hollywood remake in the works.

In a school, the teacher asks for a definition of hope. I have a better definition than the one given. Hope is the expectation that one may be able to create an effect in the future that one is not able to create now.

I am living in here for the hate comments to the US. The time has come :)

Great movie 🎥 🔥 🤘 💯

Saw this in theatres one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, superb.

Tried to watch it twice. Suuucks. Effects are like an old video game, characters are caricaturesesk and extremely predictable. Boring.

CHINA STEPPING UP THEIR GAME

Where can I watch it?

This ... actually looks good

Netflix is streaming now.

Looks like Chinese "Meg"

I wanna watch this

move with earth

Pretty average IMDb rating

I watched it today. It is fantastic Sci-fi movie filled with emotions and perfectly shown how the humanity together can achieve big goals. Hats off to the complete film crew. Would love to watch it again with English Dubbed. Love from India.

Love most Chinese Action movies for their wild exaggerated action scenes! Very underrated in my opinion and this one looks fantastic!!! Definitely going to watch this!!!

Oh man! Youtube scientists are going to have a ball ripping the physics apart on this movie. But it looks wicked awesome!

I would love to see this movie!

Chinese movies are always amazing to watch specially war sci fi

This looks spectacular

american : china steal our technology to make hollywood movie china chinese : we are strong enough to make the movie others country : both just shut up and watch movie silent pls china chinese and american : ......

Where is Donnie Yen? This looks great.

China is finally catching up with the west in the quality of its movies. Now if they can avoid becoming poison like elite Hollywood they will surpass them.

I am a Nepalese guy. I really love Chinese movies. This movie as this is based on future. And I request the Chinese film makers to continue for hope.

Na kuck an jetzt rettet uns also der Chinese und ich dachte immer der Amerikaner. Hach mein Weltbild bricht zusammen. 來自德國的問候

efek sih keren, sepertinya cerita kurang mantap

I was wondering when China would create space films considering they are a leading force in space travel.

Oh a Chinese remake of Armageddon.

soundtrack name at 1:04 ?

So,what happened with moonn..?

Wow amazing!

I dont like the concept of moving the whole planet. Still gonna watch this movie if i have the chance...

中美两开花，全特么给我开起来

A science fiction movie with an actual science angle?!?  Color me interested.

looks like a great space movie

1:41

This looks really good

tumben film cina ga lagi ala-ala negri dongeng terbang penuh hayalan, dari trillernya very very good movie

plot: if interstellar was made in china

wait, was this guy firing a minigun at a planet?

No more in Hollywood movies USA save mankind from extinction. Time for Chinawood 😎👍

Is it dubbed in English?

Watch it. It is awesome

flat earth, no solar system

I have to see this movie... 😮

Okay china you got me interested

This looks crazy good

Great international movie. US remake in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...

it was a good movie, worth watching

I think every freaken life form on earth should realize that one day the sun will die, there is no escape within the solar system. If the human kind wants to extend their very existence, THEY MUST LEAVE THE SOLAR SYSTEM - JUST LIKE WHAT THIS MOVIE TRIES TO CONVEY.

I saw this movie and it was pretty good I would give this a watch for anyone who like action and a sorta space adventure

I wamt to watch it.

Wow, It’s rare to see this kind of movie from China. I like it.

I dono why but I like the movie ........

Excelente PELICULA , EXCELENTE TESIS ... GRACIAS NETFLIX.

Looks like one glorious CGI fest .

Looks Epic and big Budget! wish it were english but if its great ,ill put up with subs

I read the Three Body trilogy earlier this year and was totally blown away. How does this live up to the grandeur of that work?

I feel like the director really liked Armageddon.

MIGHTY CHAH-LI-NAH!

Hope they make an English dubbed version. I hate reading subtitles for a whole movie

I fell asleep !

For anyone wondering its a really good movie a must watch i just saw it today and loved it

Just watched this on Netflix in Chinese. Awesome movie, but should I watch it again in english dub?

Mass effect Andrometa...

What a movie  ♡♡♡

It reminds me shadow riders by the errant planets using turbines to move planets

WE NEED THE THREE BODY PROBLEM MOVIEEEEEEEEE!

3000 years ago China can built The Great China is Wall, so........in the future why they cannot move the earth? Oh wait! It is a fantasy.    10/10

We only have 2D version here, but my friend has seen both, and told me 3D was way more amazing with the visual, wish I was in China 😂

I would watch it, I am tired of King Kong 25, Avengers 17, Batman 32. Hollywood is really starting to put out junk.

It was actually good.

Now Jing Wu gonna kick another catastrophe

Luckily, I have seen GORATH (1962) and I can both speak English and read English Subtitles. I humbly accept your applause.

This is one more step in the Chinese owned globe.

China is an awakening giant.

Dang lol I was hoping for a Skell to show up.

Wow. Hollywood beware

The movie had really great effects and scale, it looked nice, however, it seriously needed to work on the pacing and editing, the story was told in chunks of events without any real care on how they should be connected, insignificant events had the same weighting as a major one, there were unnecessary slap stick comic relief characters that were very cringey. Having read the Three Body Problem books, at first I could not believe this was a Liu Cixin story given its goofiness, it was a relief to learn that the story had been significantly altered for the big screen. Perhaps the longer director is cut would improve a lot of the issues, I look forward to it when it is available.

can you pls ad italian traduction thanks

Amazing

I think I saw someone shooting at the planet Jupiter with a Gatling-gun?

Spolier Alter: Armageddon in international version. 1.5 million people (soldiers and engineers) from the whole world carries 70k flints to rescue 10k engines. The movies is just a story about one Chinese rescue team kidnapping three civilians, which almost failed all steps of the rescue, there are other teams acting faster (or luckier) than them, and other country is scientists come up ideas earlier than them. The Chinese team only plays a key role at the very end, when everybody lost their hope, this team still insists to do the mission impossible, and they failed again. Until the father of the protagonist decided to sacrifice his own life and put the last hope the humanity at risk, they made the impossible ... well ... possible.

If i wanted to read a movie, I would watch a book. Wait what?

Looks good , subtitles going to be hard to read though. I now see how they feel reading American made movies.

lol，so many china hater are crying here.

is that the red alert siren at 1:03 ??

Chinese traveling through space? Will be loud... i am going to watch this movie

I watched it two days ago, and it is damn amazing! With only about $50 million cost of the movie, it is pretty good as $100 million Hollywood Sci-fi movie. Some ppl might think it is about Chinese save the world, but actually it is not. It is more like about how all human beings from different countries, work together to save ourselves. No more individualistic heroism, but with more internationalism.  I was so moved by father-son relation. I strongly recommend u to watch it with IMAX 3D, cuz the visual effects are really good. And i am pretty sure u can find it at AMC cinemas and Cineplex cinemas in North America. It might not on the main page of cinemas' websites, but just search it and u will find out.  I think it might be one of the best Sci-fi of the year, it is worth the ticket! Somehow, I kinda wanna watch it again lol.

la wea buena ctm chinos ql saludos desde chile

This movie looks absolutely amazing I cannot not wait to see it

Another movie that is scientifically impossible, the Earth would face catastrophe if it stopped spinning. Underground cities? Why not stay there? And it would be dark on the surface of Earth if it was near jupiter, yet in the movie it is full on sunshine apparently.

Luce increíble!

I saw the movie and the story was pointless don’t get me wrong the special effects is awesome but they could make it short not 2 hours and half.

Is this coming to Phillippine Theathers? Still waiting

Looks awesome!

Erection

Efek cgi yang melebihi film film holiwood ....keren boss ni film..!!

There are subtitles in theaters, do not worry. Movie was really great, something you do not see a lot.

Erection Erection Erection Erection

Does anyone know the mass of planet earth and how much newtons it takes to move it?  OK, Sci-Fi. Time to get the popcorn ready. LOL.

Wu jing has become a box office superstar.

What a complete and utter load of dug meat !

And now chinese conquering CGI effect too their damn good

this is awesome movie... shows us the importance of hope...

Why cannot movie release in hindi language

The chinese are dominating the universe now..

The idea is BRILLIANT. but the packaging, hollywood still ...

The movie can be amazing but watching this on Chinese with Chinese subtitles sucks, but they will do well with the Asian viewers.

Ulusal sinema şirketlerinin tüm filmlerinde son yıllarda dünya nüfusunun yarıya indiğini yada indirilmek istendiği konu ediliyor sürekli, bu şeytan ülkeler bir bok yiyecek, belliki insanları alıştırıyorlar sürekli bu tür filmlerle

CORRECTION!!!

i get it, so this is the reason why china is number one. splendid

I wait for EP2 best movie

wenstern sifi :Earth is dead, lets just leave.  Eastern sifi :Earth is dead, lets just rebuild our home.

Lord, this looks like as bad as the drivel that is produce out of Hollywood!

Dope............😮🙏

this is like a prequel to porter robinson is shelter. i mean if it really crashed, that is...

🐒 the Earth is on pillars and doesnt move. We are in a dome. 😂😂 what a silly movie..All 🐂💨 🙊🙊

How Death Stranded The Game should be!

Hoping for Part 2, very nice Movies, all countries uniting for the sake of Our Mother Earth, amazing.

Shooting at a planet. The definition of futility.

Disappointed. Some scenes look like the exact reproduction from other sci-fi movies/tv shows i have seen. I watched for more than half of the film, but did not bother to finish. I got bored by the story and the English dub is annoying, which maybe the reason why I could not feel a connection with the characters. It just lack emotions. I cannot even remember the last scene where i stopped watching.   The plot is interesting though.

Definitely want to see this movie this is way cool

Correction.exe has stopped working

Coming soon on Netflix near your PC, TV and Phone.

Malditos chineses vão dominar o mundo! Kkkk

I just saw the entire movie .....

Must see..

Chinese movie can hit Hollywood like this, it is a really good movie.

wth, the trailer is a big spoiler. good movie though.

I not one to read subtitles. I will like to watch this AMAZING movie and APPRECIATE the FX cause they looks SUPER AMAZING. Hope they do an English or french version.

chinese movie looks better. loveyah

Netflicks does not have a trailer for it is own movie. Thank you.

Uncle Tang is that you?

Although this looks sick, it still cannot beat interstellar sorry!

我来看看有多少国人hhh

The manderin language is the best option if you select english language it sounds so bad...

Is a great movie graphics acting top notch

I watched it, it was a good movie.

1:40 to 1:42 Saw a spider.

It irritates me that we seldom get English or French (I am French Canadian) translations for those good Chineses movies. It would make our delight and break ethnical barriers!

Ребята, где можно посмотреть этот фильм?

我发现好多人都在装老外呀

There are a lot of goofy comments here.  This story takes place in the future  when Earth is governed by the "United Earth Government" headquartered in France. There is no China or United States or any other country.for that matter .Everyone is a citizen of Earth. The story line is Earthlings versus the Cosmos.  For those gripping about the cast, let me explain.  In Italian movies you get Italian actors. In Brazilian movies you get Brazilian actors,  This is a Chinese movie.  Are you bright enough to connect the dots?  Give credit where credit is due. Wandering Earth is a brilliantly original and exciting story line.

一群精神外国人

Still waiting

The only reason I watched this is because a film critic named David  Ehrlich said it was not any good.   He is a terrible film critic so I  did not listen.    As usual David has NO idea what he is talking about.

looks epic asf. it is just that I cannot understand a thing.

Lo que me sorprende es que 1 solo actor haga todo. Increible... :v

Sci-Fi movie make everything seems possible and yet still cannot find a cure for cancer.

So one way to convince people to learn mandarin when you don’t care that profit is the priority.

A Chinese movie about how, in the vast emptiness of space, the earth somehow manages to get on a collision path with Jupiter while being moved away from an expanding sun. Anyone who has experienced the horror of driving in a Ranch 99 parking lot should be able to relate to this plot

How good is the movie? THinking about watching

BYE BYE AMERICAN CINEMA 👌

Very funny, flying earth.

China have made a few descent movies .. just downloading now .. it looks worth a watch... Thanks for the trailer

We dubb for y the u guys please dubb for us! Lol this looks epic.

A couple of questions: 1)  How can Jupiter suffer a "Gravitation spike"? 2) How does that effect Earth in any way?

So... is no one going to talk about the chicken sound @ 0:03?

The comment section is like a war movie. everyone is fighting who is the best country. and here i am thinking "hmmmmm i wonder how Philippines survived from all of this chaos"

ALV!, eso es un trailer o toda la pelicula?, mejor lo quite al minuto y medio y me fui a ver la pelicula!. WTF!, this is a trailer or the complete movie? Im better close YT and gone to see the movie!.

China save the scifi.

Worth to watch!

The movie was not mind-blowing, but the concept was really cool and unique. Beats most Hollywood doomsday movies by a mile. Reminded me of Snowpiercer.

Looks awesome

i need the free movie link

Meh it looks okay but not worth reading subtitles for the whole thing.

Cina layar lebarnya berkembang banget CGI bukan kaleng2 lg...

Booooo the Earth is FLAT!!

So just to be clear, the guy at 1:40 is unloading his minigun at... the planet jupiter?

Good movie but... the girl literally spends 90% of her lines crying or shouting for someone to save her. The most annoying character i have ever seen in my life..

the earths flat & stationary.  its not wandering anywhere

1:40 Is man shooting bullets at Jupiter?

So....we failed to leave the earth, we fly the earth to a new place instead.

Whos seen this pl rate

Jesus this looks good !

牛逼！

I want to watch this movie because of Chang An

I watched it and was impressed with the non stop action and what looked like a big budget spent on it. But what lets it down is the childish juvenile acting that so many Asian films produce.

We should take the earth and push it somewhere else a film based on Patricks idea i am interested

Interstellar?

Enjoy the trailer for The  Chinese sci -fi box-office smash his the wandering Earth .

OK CHINA 🇨🇳!  I see you boo!!!!

I love this movie we need more movies like this one

The China film industry has awaken!  Hollywood move aside!

Love so much of this trailer . I am waiting to this movie

What is up with all those stupid humans that cannot look at a damn trailer and just appreciate a movie? Come all full of political opinions and they are ALL experts about China..they all have lived in there for years and work there they know EVERYTHING about China..amazing! Trailer is amazing!I hope China start to get better and better on the movies industry.

i am kinda worried on the zip quality of that astronaut suit.

Looks GREAT

CGI looks so good, no wonder, Japan and china are going to takeover the world. They deserve it, bcz They are far better than us

I learned English because the first time I watched Godzilla I thought Hollywood is the best.  Later I started learning Korean cause I found the simple, no big FX or CGI movies they make have really deep impactful stories.  Then again later I had to learn Japanese because...Anime, they were not just cartoons.  I am already pretty tight scheduled guys....And now Chinese!!!  Come Onn!!! 🥺

a dubbed one in English???

well the graphics are not soo good. the cgi looks fake.

Good👍👌

There should be some parody of this one,like Wandering Craftworld or Wandering Terra,even Wandering Rock.

Did u guys find out the one of the highlights where the the final solution that ignites Jupiter to let earth escape turns out to already have been proposed by israel scientists first and then is successfully executed by ppl from all over the world under the call of chinese team

can listen to Japanese but Chinese, i cannot. sounds weird same as Portuguese.

Who produces? Chinese or westerner

The Commies save the world! YAY!

This movie looks badass... i am definitely watching it...

Looks really good

Space 1999

Anyone wants this movie in hd I have just replyme I will give the link

Looks really good

Next, Bollywood sci-fi movie...

CiXin Liu good job。It is a pretty good work。 刘慈欣的作品真的非常棒。

This movie setting record in china

this is the kind of scifi i like. batshit insane complete nonsense magic fantasy story as an excuse for crazy action setpieces. sail the earth to a new star system indeed :D

特来站队支持流浪地球！

America : Only we can save the World China : Hold my Gleckes

Looks good. cannot wait

大中国，祝福你。你踊跃在我心里。我巴西人。中国是美国。我的中文老师也中国人。我学习中文。

Lets fire a space mini gun into a super massive swirly thing Hmmm right O.

Bonkers Sci-Fi at its best.   so at 1:40  is that guy really trying to shoot Jupiter ?  cause I think he might need a slightly bigger gun to get the job done :)

It certainly looks a lot better than Star Trek Discovery

netflix好像有买这个，不知道外国朋友喜不喜欢这电影

chinterstellar

I am indian. This will be my first chinese movie😁😁 will be in english but that is okay

Hello everyone The Wandering earth Not only out of the solar system, but also solve the problem of women around the world menstruation，thankyou for your goodjob China

组队撞针（Team for percussion pin）1/100

Itulah kenapa kita harus menjaga bumi dari sekarang

ChinArmageddon!

I was going to say. Whait ! China does movies xD Hahaha than 30 secondes later. Damn !!!! I wanna watch this !!!

This was a good movie

Wow. I cannot stand to read it all. But if they dubbed this movie on English for American audiences it would surely be a box office smash here as well

Very nice movie :)

So if I eat more meat, then this is a possible future? Nations and people uniting together to save everyone?

the movie  that made hollywood looked like bollywood

As a Chinese, I think the significance of this film is not in special effects or plot bridge, but it shows me that the Chinese film industry and idea has reached a passing level.

Se ve interesante

This actually looks pretty bloody impressive. Top notch CGI and set design. I do not really know the story but I would watch this for sure.

Make nems no spaceships...

CHINA is now the new Boss of the world!

Is this Armageddon. In Chinese version. ????

Chinese machine only look good on film

So, mankind try to use jupiter gravity swing-by for driving earth itself for the longest jorney.  But people miscalculated distance from jupiter, right? Interesting story.

using all those engines are not going to completely destroy the atmosphere?

wow super

Wow

DAMN CHINA!!

Is this on Kodi yet ?

Cool

East vs West....China working its way to hollywood!

Jupiter dont need to came so closse to distroy us.

ugly space suit 1:27

I know the concept of this movie, though I have never seen it.  I must ask this:  Do they explain why they created super large engines capable of propelling Earth out of orbit and the solar system instead of just created spaceships with the same capability?

China is the furthest country in my mind that deserves a 2nd chance.

I really do not like to read wen watching a movie but, I will give it a go. I like movies like this...

Awesome movie have big potential for franchise.

Moving earth away omg sound like a good idea until logic strikes. Whitout the sun it would be too cold to travel !2500! years (planes in the air not possible due to freezing motors/oil) and whit out the right proper gravity the water levels etc will change so drastict that it would seem like the apokalyps. In short all life would 100% die out if any of this would be done.

How do they go potty?

This movie was confusing; the plot is unbelievably good, the special effects are great SOMETIMES. Other times the CGI is so bad I actually cringed. The acting also varies from good to unbearable, the movie seems to rush certain events as in it can be hard to follow at times. As I said, the initial plot is very interesting but it seems to become nonsense at the end. For physics accuracy, the film has a lot of things right but also some things are just ridicilously incorrect. I do not really know how I feel about the movie 😅 6/10 maybe?

Is this only in Chinese? I really want to watch it but I don’t want to be reading a book with moving images

What’s with the guy shooting M134 up in the sky for? There’s no alien right?Or it is... Ooooo spooky af

Trailer edited very confusingly, but movie might be interesting. Hoping it avoids the two big Chinese movie pitfalls: being over acted and wuxia. I do love a few Chinese movies.

...what an unwatchable flick; ugh, amateur hour...

1:40 WTF is he shooting at....?

nice movie sci-fi

The concept and story is really good. The animation part not quite close to Hollywood.

As chinese. i am so skeptical about watching it .....

This movie looks ridiculous...............ly awesome! I cannot wait to check this out.

did he just shoot jupiter with a mini gun?

Lacks diversity

lol imagine a chinese made space craft,,,,,, well if most things built in china are a guide,,,hmmmm you guess the rest.

In the sequel they have to make it past Uranus.

Indoooonesia

China has decided that from now on, they are the ones who will save humanity, not the USA. 😂😂😂😂😂

It not released in India ! Why?

Tiongkok go go go...

Whos watching in 4520?

Paman Tat!!!

It is just a movie, no need to get all political and start a pissing contest.

Wow

Meh. Terrible character development.

This is on Netflix in English very good crazy but good

I hope the fix the grammar in the captions for us none Chinese speaking folk! For a half billion and growing gross movie you would think they will do that before streaming it.

When earth is made in china

go China ,this looks good !

Great Movie about our Planet

Who is here after watching what if.

If you build "thrusters" all round the world with enough power to move it, they would... oh, never mind. I hope at least they do not show a montage of them all firing at once or something, because that would be Core levels of dumb.

no way, only american can save the world.

wow, even if it is Chinese propaganda, that actually looks good.

in fact, chinese author just want to show this great project from a young boy and girl is eyes. After watching you can find that there is not the only hero, everyone should be hero and provide their favour and power to help earth. i am really moved. I think this is what the chinese style and their spirit. Just enjoy it and think about ourselves.

I do not like it when a film has an English title but is not in English...this film looks good but I missed most of what happened because I was reading the subtitles...

An awful movie that comes nowhere near the likes of Interstellar. It has high ratings because Chinese are paid to leave high reviews. Just glad I did not waste my money seeing it in the theatre.

Wow! It is Chinese interstellar?

sulawesi

What are they going to do with the moon? Throw a rope around it and tug it along like a dingy?

😴

Right now (march 16th) this is the number 1 movie of 2019 worldwide

Realy funny story!But no one can save us from America.Only solution is to leave USA on  the  Moon and to continue our journey.Good people of USA are welcome to join us,ofcourse.

An updated Gorath. Neat.

you can watch it on netflix right now. with english subs or dubbing if you can stomach dubbing.

Wish it was in English

As a Spanish boy I love Asian and Chinese

Finally!! The Chinese are giving Hollywood a run for their money. This looks like one hell of a rollercoaster ride!! I cannot wait to see it.

This comment section is so toxic.

10.20

I dont have any expectations for Chinese films,  at least at this point of time. But seeing the review here, Im interested. Hollywood is boring

Who’s here because of Screen Junkies/Charting with Dan?

If only China would stop polluting most of the world. That would be a movie

This is a professional fiction movie, as good as hollywood movies. (if you dont care political value in the movie..)

Vaya los chinos estan mejorando, esperemos que el guion tambien sea bueno, deberian incluir actores conocidos del mundo aunque sea los de reparto.

That title. . . Lol

Wowwwew

this will be the best movie the world has ever watched

In american movies, they save the day. Quite normal for this to happe.

mini gun VS Jupiter

Shut up about the sun!!

It actually looks pretty good to bad it is not playing near me

Used to be America will save the world, now it is China will save the world, cos at this point, in reality, they anyway run the world🤷‍♂️

' Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth. And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.' Isaiah 24:17-21

1:41 Was he shooting bullets at Jupiter?

Lame, great wall in space, how come they could not get any established round eyes to sell this silly trash. Sunshine way better film that actually stars a multinational cast saving the world, where this is all Han people???

Correction

Better than those Hollywood movies

I loved this movie.   Sometimes I hope for a major problem to unite humanity.   It seems likely to be the only future where we stop destroying ourselves.  I hope we all grow up before we have WW3,  stop fighting,  and work together to explore the universe.  We all deserve better than the present.

These future Earthlings are up against the sun. Current Earthlings are up against psychocrats. Let is wreck psychocrats so we can deal with the sun.

Okay, this looks cool! Will there be an english dub?

ahh jupiter hugged earth

The best movie from China which can beat Hollywood. Who agree?

nice movie!!!

When the special effects are awesome,,, but you are busy reading,,,  sorta sucks.

china film

America: "D1verSity Is OuR Stengf!1" China: just shuts up and makes a good movie

Do they learn how to drive in this movie? If not, then I am out

Hold up...this is based on tht Liu Cixin is short stories??!! But instead of running away from the sun they run away from jupiter

Can we get Neil deGrasse Tyson to consult on this?

Best tralior...I want to see this movie.....😱😱😱👍👍👍

Save us CHINA !

This movie is surely great with its unique story of cerebral sci-fi. Truthfully, I already got bored with those superheroes Holywood movies. They just franchises-hype for me personally. I do want watch it in cinema, but unfortunately, this movie will not shown in my country. Yah, movie distributors here are just give interest to more profit movies. That is why superheroes movie will dominate a lot of studios in my cinema. Tch!

Time waste movie depends on only graphics

Заебись фильмец

would it have not been easier to just go to other planets lmao

They need to have black and other races as the stars of their films. The Jews say everyone has to mix except them..

another sci fi movie with pseudo science #1 the idea that the sun will inflate in 300 years to eat the earth is stupid science #2 even if the sun enlarged why not move to the earth into a further out orbit, nope they come up with this ridiculous idea of moving the earth 1000s of light years away just to make it sound cool

Superb efx..wow marvellous

Haaaawwwahchuwaaaan

Qu Chuxiao (as Liu Qi) has a nice face but everytime he acts surprised it looks annoying. Li Guangjie (as Captain Wang Lei) and Wu Jing (Liu Peiqiang) are great actors though.

This movie is NOT made solely to please the western audience. It just demonstrates that China is now beginning to make their own sci-fi movies and local audience is already one of the biggest market in the world and they are buying it. Hollywood will need to make better movies in the future because movies which are resonate to local culture and context are more appealing and relatable. And we hate subtitles too! China is rich in history and they will not be short of inspirations and stories.

Now you know how shity was Hollywood all these decades.

F*cking cinema dont have this movie in  their list, does anyone know where to find it online??

At 1:40, he is shooting a rail gun at Jupiter. That is why I must see this movie.

bether then end game

For everyone crying about Hollywood movies where Americans save the world...what you expect. The majority of those movies are made by American studio is directed towards American audiences. I see a lot of hate in these comments directed towards American movies where we save the day but yet the world market spends billions every year watching our movies,sports, music ect.

Communism will live.

The entire premiss is flawed. Earth and everyone on it would die if this were attempted.

Go to google n search rmcmv.us n download this movie n new movie u want..just share

Adaaa mwoneyyy kidilan trailer

Entertaining movie. Pretty ridiculous, but very enjoyable.

wait... just wait !   There is science fiction, and the there is downright idiocy!     You move Earth out of its orbit, there would be no more night and day cycle, duh!  Also, oceans would freeze solid - and thrusters.... really thrusters to sail the Earth... and to the next star system in 2500 years, oh come on!  I know how to make leaps with Sci-fi, of course I do - but please this is beyond any stretch of the imagination!

To bad their is a firmament, these satanic lunatics lie.  Just CGI games

Thanos was right

Where were they planning to bring the earth tho?

Americans in total panic. First China overtakes them in Tech, now China overtakes Hollywood. USA, a regional power. China the new most powerful country in the world.

Chinawood

And China destroying earth as we watching this

Budget: 50 million USD Hollywood could never make a masterpiece Sci-fi flick on that budget. 10/10

Ummm, i am not about to watch the captions and listen to this movie. I now see how they feel watching American movies 😑😒😐...

I hope they do not let Muslims take the helm; they will fly us into the sun.

how the earth achieve gravity  without circular movement..  everything should  floated  daaaa

Want to watch this; seems really interesting.  Wonder what else China produces that is good (at least good for me) that I am missing.

Jupiter even u are Made in China

Chinese value Family and Team work. American Movie value, individualistic and one hero.

I lik... correction ... I think I lik.... correction ... I ... correction ... this looks like go.... correction ...

Nice plot for a movie.

this movie musthave injury warning, that u can do to yourself with facepalms

I want this movies in English

This is the best piece of Chinese propaganda i have seen in my life

Anybody else judge a good space sci fi movie on the quality of the spacesuits design ?

Vfx are realllllllllllllly good man

Very cheesy

Looks amazing!!! I wanna see it now  XD

For a Chinese movie, the special effects are good. Other than that, you should be the judge if you can tolerate a movie that is missing things you would otherwise take for granted in a Hollywood production. The movie could have made more money if they bothered to dub the languages for the local foreign markets. Why not distribute an English, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, German, etc. The movie is geared for the Chinese market. They did not bother to alter the movie for foreign distribution, unlike the way Hollywood changes its films to enter China, so there is that hypocrisy on China is side. YMMV. I have seen the movie. I will not remember it, because there is nothing I have not seen before. You might since it is coming from China and that might be of interest for you.

Creo que esos Asiáticos se la están rifando con esta película

Guys why are you even comparing China having a culture of thousand of years, with America without any distinguished norm let alone culture?

film from china is the best

Correction...

It is ok .it does not capture watcher s brain this is over technic view but it  views drama,too.I like it.

I thought the world needs Jews to make a movie?

Crapmagedon

Can someone explain to me what the problem is? EDIT: to be clear how the helll did jupitar is gravitational pull  won over the sun is gravitation to have the earth stay off course its trajectory around the sun?

1. why is the computer speaking in english? 2. was he....shooting a Jupiter?

Urakai

As a Chinese i have to say if it was Hollywood filming this story it could be a better movie than what it is . better special effects for sure,better acting and directing perhaps. But truth is this literally was the first real deal sci-fi movie ever made by Chinese so i couldn’t ask for more 7.5/10 i suppose

I like this movie. Worth 2 hours.

you could not planet thrust this planet , first its spinning fast , second you would burn the atmosphere off of it , think about this when you decide to argue with me , we were hit by a exo-planet early in our origins and it did not move the earth so much as blew pieces off and made 2 moons that crushed together and became one  , that the heavy ass earth kept in its gravitational pull , of course flat earthers could just have the giant turtle pull it , be about as realistic , I can see trying to move the moon , planet earth is not science fiction it is science fantasy

Hohohoho

So at the start they say everything is getting hotter so the oceans are drying up , then they talk tsunamis ?... wtf.?

Decent movie. Though they overused the self-sacrifice thing a little too much, kinda like Interstellar, with less able-actors. Truly there are big gaps between Hollywood and China cinematography. i am Chinese descendant, but cannot connect to their emotional acting as much as the Hollywood counterparts.  Stop going about nationalism and "American saves the world" , movies should only be judged on their contents alone. Everything else is just political correctness.

God damn that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. There are sci-fi scenarios more believable than this. Like the ones we used to read in sci-fi comics and magazines . Remember magazines ppl ? yeah before internet. Now every mothertrucker on Earth is trying to do more than the previous generation and its always a disaster.

Looks foreign

I wish it was in English I hate subtitles

This was honestly a pretty good epic sci-fi movie. There were a few problems with it like the main protagonists lack of character and some questionable actions made by them and some other side characters, but overall, pretty solid. The plot does not really make any sense, but what do I know i am not a physicist, but outside of that, it was really good. The acting was actually pretty solid, CGI were also on par with mid budget Hollywood movies, which is understandable considering this movie is budget in itself. I really do not get the low ratings people give on imdb and rotten, this was a really good an enjoyable movie, and had some pretty motivational/emotional moments as well. Worth the watch.

frisky dingo

Very nice movie 👌

ok...maybe...just add zombies

LO SIENTO NO HABLO TAKA-TAKA...................

on the money

China did it,,,,its like marvel

do anyone can tell me where can i watch or buy this movie???

Very disapointed... Read the novel after i read Three Body by the same author, the novel were actually really fken good! but this movie is a joke and a waste of time... CGi is definately well done, but the acting... is just fken shocking...

very cool

looks awesome but i hate reading movies & shows.. when is it coming to Netflix? I think they said theyre doing voice overs on it for us non cultured mfs

So the Chinese buy Mars with bad money and drive up prices so Martians cannot afford it any longer?

Watched it. The movie had a lot of potential but :  1. Too many characters. I do not know who to care about! 2. Character motivations not properly established. No character devt.  3. Main characters are just passengers to the plot, being carried around randonly.  But all in all, Chinese cinema is learning fast. The story has a coherent plot and visuals are stunning. No more bullshit propaganda messages, and characters dont take themselves overly seriously like other chinese movies. The Chinese just have to get over a few more filmmaking issues as I mentioned above and they will be able to make movies on par with Hollywood.

I have seen a few of the newer Chinese films, and I am impress at the quality and creativity. There not like the Chinese Spaghetti movies that are quickly done. one that I saw was the Chinese driving out Japanese pirates, that is worth watching again. The problem with the Hollywood movie, there over blown, over cut, jerky camera movements. They have lost something over the years. The golden age of Hollywood was the golden age of Hollywood.

super string

Watching the trailer because Netflix bought it, and this looks really good, hopefully they will not just have English subtitles but have decent english voiceovers too. Based on the trailer, it kind  of reminded me of the movie, Armageddon.

what is name this Flime?

Hideo Kojima approves!

Irrational science concept! Anybody with basic physic knowledge knows the earth can’t be moved like this. Small alteration on the earth’s original speed will create Inertia force enough to destroy the whole earth. This is like the American remake of J-horror movies. No substance. Just a propaganda.

Nice film, it would be shame if someone were to.. ...make a cheap knock off >.>

Ask New Movie ? Or old movie ?

Actually good movie.

This is whats missing from follywood

so the day after tomorrow had sex with armeggedon and had a baby Geo storm Clone --- ill watch it :)

Tiene un parecido a cosmos 1999.

you mean corruption

Well-made action packed apocalyptic sci fi thriller.  Perfect for ADHD types as the shots are usually 2-3 sec long.  I speak very little Mandarin, so it was a struggle to quickly read the subtitles THEN catch the brief action shots.   Overall an entertaining ride and efinitely worth watching despite the hammy acting and liberally borrowing themes from previous sci fi films.

Chinese cinematography are similar to Chinese phones. Partly perfect and partly disaster. Huawei,Xiaomi etc...

Umm.. yeah you can move the earth but... did you forgot the moon?

Thism9 ir sucksasstoomuch cgi and the English audio la Crap as well

Chinese 2012. Cool.

Good Movie and good Food

I wonder where are the Indian???

Watch it in Netflix very very nice movie

Hope they release this movie worldwide

Dafuq is this man tryna achieve shooting a mini gun at JUPITER at 1:40

Looks great and I would indeed like to watch it. Yet the question is, will there be an english version of the film? Having to read subtitles while watching a sci-fi movie is quite the showstopper. Even a version dubbed to english would be acceptable.

Greedy chinise

And....... Another Hollywood wannabe

Chinese people on indonesia sulawesi save the world

i am from U.S. and I like  what I am seeing so far from the trailer. I am not really surprised about how far the Chinese movies has become. I have enjoyed watching different genres of Chinese films for more than 30 years. From comedy to horror, and martial arts adventure to sci-fi and fantasy. I say they are right up there now when it comes to sci-fi films.

2.0 is expensive and good visuals but not a good sci fi movie than this damn it indian movie makers should learn from chinese  movie makers or its just us audience who needs to accept good movies instead of senseless movies

I hope this is not another Air Strike. That would be tragic.

Bluckbuster trailer

This is just like others end of the world movies

The movie is good, but dont think too much about science

Shusha shusy shashu shyshy. Es lo Unico que entendi.

Alien Covenant is way more visually impressive than this movie, and that got average reviews...

THERE IS ONE ASIAN DOING BETTER THAN YOU EVEN AT THE MOVIES.

Interesting premise but if you really want to propel a planetoid between star systems, all you need to do is detonate a nuclear waste dump, right?

Why not just grab your hair and leave the earth

The only reason i am kind of against these scifi movies from China is because they tend to have awful cg. Story are usually good though.

Such a waste !!! Wonderful concept and cinematography but screenplay - direction-Acting are worst .... Overall boring and irritating movie.....u Chinese first learn acting

it was ok, but a little to cheese.

Wanna see it.

Marvel vs. Chinese

The americans think  we saved america so then we save the world ! The chinese one WE SAVE THE WORLD AND ALL THE HUMANS !!👍🏽🤙🏽👑

Abe yaar ye chi chu nahi sunna h eng  dub/sub up karo

น้องของพระเอกชื่อไรคับเธอน่ารักชื่อจริงน่ะผมอยากติดตามผลงานของเธอ

... no good

Well Its not very diverse is? 😬

Just curious, if they have the tech to build engines to move a planet, why cannot they build generation ships to leave it behind? Yeah you kinda save more people, but without the earth spinning and leaving the sun, would not that just kill the environment (and whatever damage happens to the planets core) and starve the majority of people to death anyways? Seems inefficient.

This movie arrived 7 year late.

Noodlegeddon

leave it to the Chinese to think they can move Heaven and Earth....they have inflated opinions of themselves....really they are just thieves of the rest of the planets technology.....the Chinese do not innovate.....they copy....they steal...they pirate....should have let Japan conquer them permanently!

"Earth will collide with Jupiter" ahahahaha.  Well most of SF movies are crap, but some are crappier than others....

I hate movies in subtitles. I would rather have it in offset English.

Trash movie tbh in all aspects.

Wow.. big budget movie. Let say we do not care about the story.. But wow.. look is good. Of course, in china PA sound are in english. hehe

Hollywood is a cancer here in America! Even though I have to read really fast so I can see the clip I would watch this over the evil stars here! Looks good!

Before I go watch a Chinese movie I is rather see them demilitarize and vacate their bases in the South China sea.

All you China haters, listen. You never been to China, you never lived in my country, never lived under a totalitarian state that’s actually good. All the negative news and information attacking the mainland don’t represent my country in its true color. How you guys learn China is through the point of view of the anti-government Chinese who fled the country in the last century. Since then they never looked back to their homeland and see how drastically the government and our lives have changed. All they do is talk about how the previous generations of government officials do nasty things to their people. I live a happy life under my government because they keeps us safe and the society efficient. We don’t need to worry about terrorism, don’t need to worry about the politicians not do their job and have to vote for a new party which will be as lazy. We are wealthy enough to travel abroad to Europe, America and study. Our government keeps the communist name but the system has changed. They’ve learned the mistakes from pro-communist ruling, but also see the problems of pro-democracy, we are finding our own way, the optimum with advantages from both sides. Totalitarian government with a society that enjoys some aspects of democracy, that’s China now! I love Hong Kong, I love Mainland, I love Taiwan. United China is the best China

I have seen it on the Internet, a dull movie. . . . I will probably fall asleep after watching for half an hour. . . . No entertainment at all

wann kommt als dvd raus mal oder blue ray

Oh look, another doomsday movie pushing the end of the world scenario... no wonder people are going insane! The fact that the Chinese are getting in on the act, shows how saturated the New World Order agenda has become.

Hopefully,  no stupid kung fu in this movie

I like how China is biggest 750m block buster does not even rate as a "B movie" compared to USA blockbusters

DAs Film hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Chinessen gut gemacht!!!!

The english dub was worst, do not try it.

This movie just wasted 2hr of my life.  They basically took ideas of Armageddon (ie. End of earth mission, Man go crazy shooting, father sacrifice to save the world leaving daughter) and Passengers (ie. Hibernation pods, Space Station design, carrying DNA and seeds..Etc) and  made a hybrid movie. Why did it suck? 1) No character development 2) The son with no college education figured a solution that all the Astro physicists in the entire world overlooked? 3) The world calculated force required to move earth from existing gravitational pull, but did not factor in Jupiter is gravitational force? 4) All the people pushing behind other people to multiply man power.  This is like traditional martial art passing CHI from one to another...That is not how physics works. 5)The son blamed the dad for giving up on mom is treatment, yet that is the only way to keep him and grand father alive. 6) Unlike what most Chinese claim that USA movies only shows usa saving the world, Armageddon also had Russian astronauts. 7) The father was able to breakout of the hibernation pod despite hibernation gas already dispensed, while others crew member quickly fell into hibernation mode. 8) Suppose wandering Earth project were to fail.  Where was the space station headed while entire crew went on hibernation? 9) Instead of wasting resources to move the entire earth, why not build more space stations to move just people, food, and fuel...Is not that more effective, since they technically already have habitable target planet for the space station to land? 10) the special effect appeared very unpolished, like a rough draft, yet some argue the effect is awesome.  I thought the effect look worse than the Fifth Element from 1997. To summarize...This movie may be a huge step forward for Chinese movie industry, but it is still far from mainstream standard, regardless whether you are referring to the story, sequence, logic, special effect, character development. Do not just take my words, go watch Armageddon 1998 and compare that 21yr old movie to Wandering Earth, and see which one is an overall better movie based on the above.

Only 3.5 Billion on the planet? allllrighty then China.

Please dubbed in hindi

Chinese movies = hollywood movies

Enttäuschend. Teilweise Telenovela-Qualität wenn die Handkameras zum Einsatz kommen. Story ist absolut unrealisitisch und selbst wenn man davon absieht ist die schauespielerische Leistung .... Einfach schade ums Geld

To be clear. The Size of Júpiter is compared to earth so massive that if the planet earth fell in it would be like dropping a piece of rock the size of a regular bucket into the ocean. The planet itself would be added as a part of the core because Júpiter is mostly made of gas. Nice tráiler though. Looking forward to it.

WTF movie

Great director, great movie. But  there is one question.The earth We will be wandering for another 100 years,and man lives only underground.There is no temperature, no food, No Food ，no food, and 3.5 billion people living underground, digging tunnels can empty the ground.No toilet.Without industrial civilization.Without everything, how could man live so long underground?

hottoiiiii  kamaşuta fuckikaaaaa fugme fuguyouuuuuu

Movie is Epic but concept is bullshet it’s impossible to move earth from solar system to another place coz Sun ☀️ gravity is very strong after increasing of sun the only hope is Mars 🙂 but first will collapse murcury with sun so its impossible to servive from this impact may be whole solar system and planets will be destroyed from this 😂 i love this movie 🤔

M india. Nice movie

What year is this? The West has done this decades ago.

What a movie with real Chinese?  No Hollywood whitewash?

Do not worried WORLD...we have the ALL WHITE SUPER MARVEL WARRIORS that will save the world...with a couple black guys as side kicks.

Is this Armageddon. In Chinese version. ????

Wow, the Chinese beat Hollywood at their game: this movie sucks twice the donkey balls than any stupid American blockbuster, which is saying something. Well played China, well played....

how i am not aware this movie.. hell .. this looks awesome to me.. not sure about the story.. but looks great..

Movie is only 7 years late...

Ha ha i just watched the movie,  it doesnt seems compatible with your overpraising here,  this movie is  98% chinese scene,  1% russian,  1% other,  in the end it was a chinese man who saved the world,  not much different from some hollywood scifi movie

good

Given the quality control the Chinese have; the Earth is doomed.

Fucakaaaa youuuu jupittterrrr

我听得懂华语，俄语和印尼语。 电影里的发言太标准了！应该是找了当地演员，也不用配音！让电影感到更真实更亲切。赞!

I have no idea what this movie is about even after watching the trailer. All i get from this is there is some kind of worm looking thing in space and something something people died.

Lol chinese movie saving earth they dont even want to save earth most chinese just kill earth life not save them over 78%chinese destroy earth life and 22%only save earth life okay

Ok. the movie looks fantastic but the plot is too far-fetched even from Hollywood standards. I mean... moving whole planet out of the solar system???

Looks like a fun video game. When does it come out?

can i watch this movie..? any link plz???

Cool, china can make bad hollywood movies too!

Correct me if i am wrong but would not they need to maintain the rotation of the earth while they are moving it out of the solar system?

Being part of "our" solar system was fun while it lasted. Better than any amusement park ride, living on Earth included an annual free trip around the sun.   Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!   Now in this bit of science-FICTION, it is time to go a wandering, but seems like the path was not well chosen and includes getting too chummy with Jupiter.  Doh!  Hey, what is the deal with copying an idea by the Stones: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgIvkW5sqMc  Who is the ding dong that planned the trip? Can life on Earth really survive without a sun, a moon, rotational gravity, water, atmosphere, and all the other stuff needed for life? Nope. Oh well, enjoy the CGI and ignore the silly plot. It is a long way to Tipperary, it is a long way to Alpha Centauri, it is a long way to go.  🛸🛸🌎🛸🛸🌏🛸🛸🌍...........................................🌌  And just what does Alpha Centauri have to say about this cold dead rock trying to bust in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcJrExewkYA

American movie: American saved the world from the disaster. Chinese movie: Chinese and every nations save the world from the disaster.

World best movie

I was a little annoyed. The technology. Nothing looks like anything. Everything on the screen is either a giant square or circle filled with the same CGI glossy texture like everything is wearing a skin, and the skin looks more like randomized patterns with machine themes instead of the inner workings of an actual world. Just compare Transformers with Blade Runner to really see my issue. You look at the transformers in action their bodies moving around look like a mess. Half the time you cannot decipher arm from leg from head. Now look at the city shoots of Blade Runner. How alive and clear everything is and how your imagination creams itself.

seriously, they spend so much money for a movie that does not  make sense, CGI is are amazing

I really disliked this movie soooo much. Hyper unrealistic and the graphics were terrible.  Worst Bottom movies of all time

are not facebook and youtube controlled  by us government and censorship anyway they want since their registered in usa or did you missed that part with Snowden giving you the lollipop when he said all social networks are monitored by that same government so, check the stick in your eye first you dumb dumb patriots lol

Cool movie

1er Blockbuster chinois de science-fiction à débarquer en France par l'intermédiaire de Netflix, qu'est-ce que ça vaut? Pour tout savoir avec une critique courte et dynamique (uniquement pour francophones ^^ si quelqu'un veut traduire en chinois, pas de souci ah ah), ça se passe ICI  👉https://youtu.be/ZhzzK1uWkQM

I am not good about English ，just want to say don’t degrade others to prove this movie is grate，it sounds awful

So what exactly happening?  Are they pulling earth out  away from Sun which might be turning into supernova .. but whats with Jupiter ? Unless until Jupiter is destroyed earth cant go to trip space away from solar system due  to Jupiter is gravity ? Second most heavy object in solar system .... so they are disintegrating it ?

Finally a disaster movie that is not pushing Global Warming Alarmist propaganda down our throats. Thank-you China!

Mabuhay Philippines tang ina! 😂😂😂

The movie is kinda boring for me.

Rename it China saves the Human Race with typical campy acting, Oh and we can HACK cause we are playing an old Nintendo... -_- Better SFX than NASA though I will give it that.

Made in china The Chinese population is 1,386 billion

This will be happen “IF” China made the universe.

3…2……1…… 抬头

Some of the best sci-fi movies have few special effects.  What is really sad is that most of the time movie producers rely too much on CGI instead of focusing on the script and acting.  Two of my favorite sci-fi movies are 2001 and Gattaca.

马来西亚什么时候上映啊

A story of Chinese people go to Indonesia to save the world from Jupiter.

Could not they spend some of the money on better english subtitles? "Can not maintain airborne"? "For the sake of our children, there is nothing we cannot lose"???

Ever notice how many pirated movies come out of China but not this one? .....

中国的来这里报个道。

And this why Netflix sucks.

Why most American comments are being indirectly racist to the Chinese and the Chinese are just happy that their movie is getting recognition. Quit making us look bad and just enjoy the dam movie for what it is

Great story, great effects, great technology Too bad they did not think to do voice overs.

This is why you let America do the world saving

i watched the movie and it gave me a virus. thanks made in china

Im so proud to be Asian ;-)

中国人民真争气

Finally, we can have Chinese save the world and not always the Americans. LOL

The guy firing at Jupiter ruined it for me, lol.

Better than ANY hollywood movie

No entendi una mi3rd4 pero los efectos estan brutales.

A fast paced film filled with bad dubbing, monologues galore and science that is straight from a loony bin. Yes i know its a fantasy/sci-fi film but propelling the earth through space using thousands of hydrogen reactors and then slingshotting past Jupiter seriously. The mech graphics are pretty good and it is intense in places also as people have stated it is not another glorified 'USA saves the world again' film staring overused jarhead actor No 5. Its good to see the world working as one........well sort of. Watchable but weak with plot holes a plenty.  6/10

And us Americans will remake this and it will be God-awful.

So the Chinese think the Earth could be moved?

I will wait for the Hollywood version... 🤣

good inspire of Interstellar & Gravity Chinese show strong!

"Due to Jupiter is gravitational spike"? What??? This movie is going to be pretty stupid for anyone who knows anything about anything...

i mean its not realistic but its very cool

Everything is falling apart because it was made in China.

Hate the beginning of the movie, most characters are idiotic, making mistakes and getting too emotional.  Some characters are comic reliefs that failed, like the white haired guy.

So cool read the book. Popularity of science fiction is a predictor of a progressive society. Why China is on the rise.

this is when China Claimed Earth.....lol

Read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia. It talked about some characters having to steal a truck to do something. Gimme a break.

Boring movie too imposible to happen.going near to mercury the earth will melt.but i did not happen in this movie.

I saw Wandering Earth on Netflix and it was AWFUL. It made no sense. Teenagers save the world that is pushed out of orbit using rockets and sent on a trajectory to another sun 4 light years away ??? Dumb !!!

Should not have make fun of India.... Chaina is a great country but we indians r the best

Trás pro Brazil

Propaganda film.

Epic, not the American style one superhero saved the entire world story. Unique Chinese perspective about united efforts of mankind. The main characters are not or not the only hero’s that achieved missions.

what is this mess?! you cant just throw a bunch of money at cgi and hope for a good movie. and why is there a guy firing a mini gun at the sky? this trailer was hard to follow, they tried to jam as much climax as they can and made all the gasping moments feel boring. imho

Somebody please upload this full movie on YouTube. Thank you

Illiterate chinese use nationalism even in movie. I do not even know this movie.

🐎💩

It is just death and destruction, but despite everything they would try until the last of human freedoms ..

Looks like lately only Americans and Japanese can deal with aliens and monsters, or delve into hard sci-fi, or represent planet Earth. Then Meg came along and now this. Chinese film is no longer largely restricted to earthling Kung Fu.

The world is not just America... but Hollywood is.

Chinese propaganda

Chinese really love communism , a system which will never work in the real human society,  the collective mind deeply plug in their brains. Even liu cixin can not avoid that.  Actually the movie does not make sense, at the end of human race ,  if you want to move the earth out of solar system, you need to face millions of people who desperately do not like this, and they will fight ,argue, prevent you from doing that. So the American way of escaping earth by spaceship is the reasonable and feasible way to save human civilization, just like capitalism and communism behave in our society now.

not my type of movie although i really like sci-fi..except this

Wow thank you China...I love you 😍😍

I hate chinese because they stole our island, but this movie is amazing. -fr. Ph

Shocking movie completely blinded to all physics law .. Earth can not exist without solar system..  NO spinning = No gravity. ;  NO gravity = No Atmosphere..  NO Athmosphere = NO life NO sun = no seasons ;  NO Science  = NO Science fiction I do not know how it gets 7.5 in IMDB

Another Propaganda? No thanks.

Most of the people I know around the world would not trust humanity with something that says built in china. I personally boycott everything from China. The Chinese Regime censorship of the internet is to limit freedom of speech, and freedom of expression. The Chinese regime does not believe in live, and let live. It only believes in control by power

I saw on 9gag that this is a great movie, I will watch it for sure, but why all the dislikes, is it because of the trailer that reveals too much (I do not wanna watch it because of spoilers), movie is not that good or because of some political shit?

Хиливуде спаваш ли мирно

the debate of traveling with earth just shows culture differences between east and west. “Home” is one of the core values in Chinese people, not to abandon the place you’ve lived on in the face of death, but to move and fight together. That’s also why China has been through thousands of years in history and it’s still robust today. The idea of wandering earth is tragically romantic and touching indeed, at least for Chinese.

The worst movie i have seen this year. Waste of time, very boring and nonsense.

Looks cool, but I do not speak Chinese, and I hate subtitles & overdubs.

What a fake movie I guess its just Movie I dont see China will "Let is work together to save the world!" more on Im the strongest country in the world I do what I want or we nuke you We are the best race in the world More like a Dictator This movie is a BIG Lie.

yes the Chinese make movies as good as Hollywood - and this is not a martial arts movie - WOW.

BRAVO CHINA , GREAT MOVIE WITH TRUE EVENTS . SOMETHING LIKE THAT BE OUR FUTURE , SCIENTIST BE AGREE WITH YOU. OUR SUN IS OUR LIFE , BUT OUR SUN IS US KILLER. IN NEXT 50 000 YEARS WE ALL BE DEAD - EXTRERMINATION PROCESS NO ONE CAN BE STOPPED. OUR SUN DYING. OUR FUTURE IS REAL DARK AND COLD LIKE SPACE.

For sci-fi movies, I rather watch American made, which has better special effects and looks more real. And I prefer Wu Jing in a fighting role, not drama or sci-fi.

Oh please, this so far fetched its out of the realm of science fiction. China is going to save the earth buy pushing it out of its orbit and flying it to another star? A 2,500 year journey with no day light from any sun? This is so stupid only the communists could push this on people. And will the Chinese people exist in the future anyway with everyone becoming beige and all?

My pretty Asian masseuse told me that the movie had a happy ending!

This does not even make any sense! The US government does not even believe the climate change, how is it possible all the governments on the earth suddenly believe that the Sun will explode?

I was catfished! This movie sucks! lmao there is literally no way this would happen.... blah lol

Just watched it on Netflix. It had some moments, but overall it felt like a diluted Chinese copy of a Hollywood production. Some pretty decent CGI work, but dialogue was awful, even cringy at times, and the plot was like..meh.

Ok..but Wu Jing is getting Chubby...tho.! I will check it out. It looks pretty good. Actually Earth is heading that way in reality. I do not know about you guys but i am trying hard to get my space project on track. Anybody got a way to make some moneys ??! I cannot save anyone if I do not have enough money to fund my project... people. We all have not got that much time left. Planet X is coming through the Solar System. We will face something like the movie... Mark my words.

Plot ok, setting was graphically good.  dialogue horrible, acting and dialogue terrible cause of stupid children characters as usual.  just my opinion.

Worst dubbed trash movie ever made , filled with new world order global elite programming from start to finish , HORRIFIC and sad that they have now started to brainwash the chinese public as well though movies .... talk about naivety, its over for humanity , prepere for the devil and his angels.

this was more impressive than other Hollywood movies with overpaid actors and a crappy CGI effects..

Eine Super geile Idee und super geile Effekte, aber was für ein Kranker Mist ist das? Nichts gegen Chinesen, aber es gibt NUR sie. Andere Völker haben wohl nicht überlebt. Sehr viel Propaganda in dem Film. Das Beste war; " Die Völker haben gewählt: 11 Piloten und 709 Ingenieure". Achtung! Es sind nur Chinesen^^ Andere Völker schlagen sich wohl immer noch mit Stöcken und gehen auf Dinosaurier Jagd^^

Hollywood lose it already.... We r done with American shitt concept movies (not all but most of) if the world in danger America is the only country Wich capable to save it .wtf r u serious .who the hell r they. But Chinese bros show it we  have to work together for the win.

i am surprised their spaceship works considered it is made from China.

1:40 how to fight global warming. Seems legit

so we getting 2 adds every add now?

144 where you at? You seeing this?

Looks so good!

DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN thi looks awesome.

When are we able to pre-order both digitally and on Blu-Ray

Se ve super buena ojala llegue a colombia.

im defo waiting for this

Cool movie serbian

English Dude.......................

great CGI but story telling very bad

Why are all the characters asian? They should have at least put some minority characters in. i am so sick of seeing Chinese movies that have no white characters.

WOW!! Eat your heart out James Cameron...

could not stomach this garbage movie....from a physics point, it is total garbage breaking just about all laws of physics. ...movie is made for a child.

How on earth the engines blow the earth away when earth is spinning?

ok make sure it is not  Made in China ok

The people that hate this movie are apparently RACIST with their comments lol

Geostorm + Day After Tomorrow + Interstellar = Wandering Earth  (yawn)

Oh god a state funded movie.  HAHAHAHA!  Make sure you put China on the moon.

Subtitles suck. I will never "watch" a movie when i am trying to read what they are saying. It does not work.

'Wandering Earth' was going to be an epic for me BUT the incorrect translation between the Indian soldiers made me vomit. The Movie reeks of bias outside of the original plot. It betrayed the idea of original writers, just to please one is own political agenda. Unless Chinese media learns to keep its twisted ideologies in check, it will never achieve greatness. Rather, it will forever remain shackled to its own chains.   For record purposes, the conversation between the soldiers goes as follows: Soldier 1 - "The world is going to end soon, what are you going to do now?" Soldier 2 - "I wonder where this little girl is." Basically, the second soldier is showing concern for the announcement made by Han Duoduo instead of simply answering his colleague is question. This shows he is still thinking about how Duoduo is efforts may bear fruit and ignores his partner is question which seems more out of loss in faith.  The translation however goes as follows : Soldier 1 - "Why are these people still trying?" Soldier 2 - "It is a waste of time. Do not bother." There is an attempt to convert it into a negative dialogue out of reasons best known to the translating company which happens to be a Chinese company self-proclaiming to be the bearer of Chinese culture.  I do not believe the Novel had the same idea as the translation yet this is what millions of people are going to understand. What could have been a brilliant film, for me it ends up as a sorry attention grabber. Having said that, if the original dialogue had been what was translated, I would have had no issues. For some reasons, the translators wanted to portray Indian soldiers as 'lacking passion or resolve'. The truth when uncovered, shows something completely opposite.

I for one love chinese movies, when they are good, but this movie is horrendous. The plot makes no sense, they do not invest real time so we can learn something about the characters, in the end you do not care for the living or dying which makes the whole movie unwatchable. I am trying to finish this movie, but i is like 10 hours now I am going back and forth cause the movie is so exhaustingly long and boring. Some great special effects. I admit the idea of moving earth is neat, but just not accurate. This would end in a disaster and from a logical point of view it really does not make any sense. Why waste all resources to save a broken planet when you can just build stations and evacuate people? Or have you seen fireman trying to move houses so they do not get caught by a fire? Just nothing works in this movie. Honestly I do not get the hype for this movie.

They need 'voice over' actors just like they have for animated films to attract an american audience.

The special effects of this movie are sub quality CGI when compared to Avengers End Game, Jurassic Park, Avatar etc etc etc. ). The Wandering Earth Reminds me of SyFy channel stuff like. I noticed most remarks here are by  mostly Chinese posting their support for their local product. Why compare to Global Standard of Hollywood? Make a name for yourself if you can . Only time will tell how the world received this movie based on ranking and popularity. Will it be a true hit or a little foot note.

1:40 He is shooting bullets to Jupiter??  Ok..  this movie have achieved to be more stupid than jupiter ascending or the last fast & furious movies. If someone watch this movie, a 20% of its neurons would die.

LOL, engines move Earth? Earth colliding with Jupiter?! Wow. Dumbest thing I have ever heard. Seriously, tears in my eyes.

Wow...Chinese version of armageddon...i am pumped!...ah..NOT

Ching chong Chung chi translation: did I just watch the entire movie

the acting is pretty much garbage, if not for those two annoying boy and girl and those $5 per hour extras, i might have given it 8/10, as it is, this movie is a 6/10 at most.

After all the cheap stuff China makes which breaks just like their president is commitment to American trade, do they seriously believe they can build a real earth propeller? Lol the movie is full of Chinese kind

Chinese saving the world. What a joke 😂😂

This movie was awful, cheesy and to long....

The movie sucks. Its like almost every character in this movie is stupid. Too many cliche moments and so predictable. I guess its because of the god damn awful writing. The idea of the movie is unique though i love it such a waste.

The quality, of course, is not up to the usual Hollywood standards.  This looks like an epic SyFy movie.  I will say, however, that the quality is still very good.  It looks like China is really beginning to enter into film industry big time.  This definitely is something to be proud of, and it makes me excited to see a film of this caliber from another country.  I can see that a lot of hard work went into this, about 2 years of post-production, I read.  They really wanted to get this right, and it looks awesome.  Will definitely be watching this soon.  Keep making movies, China!

Wolf Warrior vs the universe

Plot twist. All the heroes are Taiwanese that is why they are all brave

This movie looks cool in the graphical department but the idea is silly. Noone would survive if you eject the Earth from the solar system and turn the planet into a rogue planet. The fact everything on surface will dies so fast and the remaining life forms under water maybe the deep ocean creatures could survive other wise nothing. But this movie is aimed to be a scifi with action and good effects so we can handle this and once it will be released in my place then I will certainly watch it.

looks good.  seems like a more plausible scientific basis than interstellar.

Watching this movie after watched Interstellar i can feel my IQ drop Even Bollywood can do better than this crap

High RT ratings = bad/boring movie and this is no exception. The visuals are good but actors are bad, story fizzles away after a while into boredom. Fell asleep twice and had a really hard time to finish it. Do not do that to yourself, its a time waster. Maybe the engl subtitles on Netflix did not reflect the  Chinese language in the way it was meant to be but that does not balance out the really bad acting of everyone and the kind of senseless story unfold towards boredom and call out for a temporary coma. Probably within the Chinese community this is a good flick, for anyone else a disappointment.

To be fair, this is a movie of silly plot, dubious sciencetific design, horrible horrible horrible acting, and mediocre special effect. But I am still highly fond of this movie because i am just so sick and tired of American idiotic individual heroism. That idea of "saturated rescue" in this movie is so goddamn refreshing from a world full of individualism bullshit. When shit goes south, do not call Superman, do not count on Avengers, instead, work along with other non-hero normal people in order to pull through as a collective human race. This idea, I believe, is what the world needs.

Communists in space

Enough with the Superhero movies. Go China Go!!!!!!

This looks like a mess.

They start a 2500 year journey and cannot get past Jupiter and not only do we not get past it we actually run into it?  Did you let a woman drive?  Come on guys...But yeah, looks good.

This is Why China No.1 meme was born

I dunno,,,I am a fan of sci fi movies, however usually these non-hollywood productions, as a rule, cannot get the "thing" right. If it is not the narrative then it is the CGI or the timing or the plot or something else that completely renders the movie a pile of waste. (without mentioning that a scuff movie and subtitles are ludicrous,,cos you either watching and basking in the imagery or you are reading the dialogue..you cannot do both - it is physically impossible = you are predetermined to miss out either way, unless you speak Chinese+English).  Here I am already sceptical about the premise of this "greatest sci-fi movie of 2019"- where humanity is against the odds due to our star dying - prematurely. I mean that event is calculated to take place in a couple of billion years. That is quite some margin of error! If that is the case then the script writers are proposing that even a parrot would make a better prediction about the longevity of the Sun than our best and brightest scientists.After all, if you have a well trained parrot and you would be to make a survey asking all trained parrots, I am sure one of them would say 12 years! (which is what the amount of years that the script writers are proposing we have until the Sun collapses). Why is that parrot not the head of our main scientific body then? We should start cross-breeding with that parrot immediately to create a super breed of highly intelligent parrot-humans or human-parrots! You catch my drift yet? It is utter BS right from the beginning! Plus I have not seen anything in that trailer that would make me think that this is a great visual experience - all the CGI looks somehow shy. And why is that guy shooting his gun at Saturn? Why would that bit make it into the trailer? Generally the trailer is supposed to lure you in either by the story it reveals or visuals. A guy shooting bullets at the immersive super-planet Saturn is neither. If anything it only adds to the number of questionable decisions that were obviously made here in abundance.

this movie is shit, waste my 2 hours time

Why Chinese copy USA sci fi films? Lol

Wait for Bollywood to save the Earth in a 3 hour movie with a pee break and generous amount of singing, dancing and head bobbing :)

Another Jesuit Entertainment Movie - " enter, control and contain your mind.

Meh

Oh how I hope Netflix will dub it! It is not that I have something against Chinese language, I just hate reading and focusing on the subtitles, rather than on the movie itself!

Giant thrusters to move the earth .... even for sci-fi that sounds seriously stupid....

The movie is bad 3/10 unreal and CGI plus can not with happy ending for teenagers

Dumb movie

Too many Chinamen in this movie

Now China should make a movie where they clean up all the pollution they put on the earth.  That would also be fictional.

if you mo fo s at Netflix just bought this movies for millions and you do not translate to English other than putting subtitles are the bottom.... fruck you! I want to watch and enjoy the movie, not read a frucking book on my screen!

Saw this in Boston last week. It’s basically “Armageddon” with a bit more action & special effects. Oh and you need to open your mind because it’s completely ridiculous at times🤣😂

China using all that stolen technology to make a big movie.

good that they do not have the need to implement a black actor for their quote

In Chinese films, all of the world unites to save the world.  In American films, British born actors are playing Americans who are saving the world. lmao

Ehhh this is not a good movie.

Only China can move the planet.

and they say this movie is better then alita i do not think so

woot! Chinese propaganda!

Chinese are never selfless and the movie was a "China saves the day"  kinda vibe but other than that it is okay

China Müll wie immer

When will they understand that what works in China will not work in the United States.  No matter how many special effects.  This movie should go something like this Americans build ships... Chinese make cheap knock-offs. 🤯

I watched one hour of this today.  It totally sucks.  By USA standards, it is a 'straight to Netflix' movie, but not in a good way.

This movie is more like a fantasy than a sci-fi movie. Seriously moving Earth ? 😂 Who is idea is this

China and Chinese people are different. Anyone rule for some generations the ideology of rulers will adapt the next generations. Same, in China. Its been people adapting Chinese communism in the 21st century to showcase against West with there power and hiding content and controlled social media and IPA theft etc.. will be a danger to the world once Communist try to rule the world with One party decision without any people mandate... the same happening in Hongkong, Taiwan, Tibet, and many other neighboring countries to Gain influence with Money. That plan no longer will works in Democratic nations once people mandate decides like Malaysia in recent examples Let is speak to the truth: China and India are future to the worlds with two difference ideologist communist vs Democratic. Let' cc how they cooperate with each other.  Power in the sense Science+Innovation+No.of Nations support to your words in the international community. China lacks and India still crawling in that path. So, do not think too much on anything until 2050 where India and China much need todo for there people.

You knows what’s odd/funny, is that American movies can be super racist, but at least we show that other cultures/races exist. In foreign films the only race that earth ever spawned is wherever the foreign film originated from, in this case it’s obviously some Asian country. That’s sounds bad for reasons... l...o...l...? Like did all races go extinct and all was left were Asians? Lol... the fuck. That’s fucked up recommend sci-fi Asian movie. At least a shout out, like “hey remember when life had diversity?” “Why yes, life is different now.”

Problem with a Chinese movie, is too many Chinese actors

The movie is batshit crazy on the science front. It is a really dumb film, but it is entertaining dumb and beautiful to look at. Solid 6 out of 10

taiwan no1

theres something with movies from russia, china or wherever that ruins the whole experience. And that is the lack of native english. Movies in other languages just feel fake like a soap opera. i am not even a native english speaker nor do i live in an english speaking country. I also hate movies in my native tongue, i cringe when i see them. On the other hand Train to Busan felt just allround alright.

It is worse than interstellar crossing

No originality...at min 67 into the movie you will see and hear way more from Gravity(2013) than you should do...too much green screen snow bad graphics. Wasted

Boring too much drama !

Haha, I love reading all the comments from China is 50 cent army pretending to be normal citizens. This looks like a mediocre Sci-Fi at best. i am sure it is not terrible, especially for a Chinese audience, but these disaster movies were done to death in the 90 is as I recall.

The premise seems ridiculous. If we somehow were able to make the Earth move across the universe, it would lose all of its biome and atmosphere, besides freezing to hundreds of degrees below zero Celsius.

the acting ruined it for me. seriously ive seen better acting in porn. that being said the movie looks gorgeous. story was decent although very unbelievable. overall 5/10 i wouldnt watch it again.

Has no one questioned the 3.5 billion people on the World? What happened to other 3.5 billion?

oh wow china can copy hollywood, so great!

未来不会有这个封建共产党的 this feudal communist party won’t exist in the future.

this movie is for xi zin pooh?

This is how a movie that involves saving the world should look like, all of earth working together, unlike that america only shit, amazing movie, you should watch it

funny CGI..another Chinese crap

Keep dreaming.Hollywood movies are better.

99.9% cgi

Damn this movie was bad. Cringy dialogues, charactera and script. I do not get why Chinese movies cannot understand human realistic emotions, dialogues or reactions

It is a crap. Unless you are a Chinese comunist.

Chinese Government is oppressing Uyghur community

Theres nothing wrong with Chinese or Japanese or Russians or Americans or cowboys saving the world all by themselves.  It is a fantasy movie after all.

Yay go China! Meanwhile, back in the real world, one of the most threatening problems in the world is tyrannical Chinese imperialism – threatening all the other nations in the world.

Spoilers, President for eternity Xi Jinping saves the day, and it was evil Falun Gong worshipers and Winnie the Pooh who created this catastrophe all along. Also your social credit score will be increased by five points when you watch this movie.

Worst movie of all the time and so funny. Movie forget the basic physic laws and trying to drive earth like a space ship 🚀. How ? Which law ? What about oceans on earth ? What about climate ? Simply drifting while earth from one solar system to other solar system is like a stupid concept. Instead of that spend all your resources to move all people form one planet to other planet in 100 yrs time line 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪

You really think They the Communist really Care about the World or it is habitants  ??? After all these Slaughterrings animals the most evil way ever man have seen ...not sparing  even their Own People ...their  Invasions......House Arrestings... Hacking into your Countries defence systems ....Inprisoning the people And torturing them the most evil way ......Executions ..... voileting Human rights every other day ......so on Forth ?? ??  Really ??? ....You must have been so sick.....you must be so Sick People ...see your Doctor ....

Is not it funny that Chinese leap through firewall, pretend to be people from different countries (India, Brazil, Germany, Korea...Etc)just to make a similar comment? "Hollywood sucks, Chinese sci Fi great".  Anyone with common sense knows these are fake comments.  A real person is first reaction if any would be to compare with their local movies that are more readily accessible.  The more you act so insecure (having to lie, to pretend, to attack), the weaker you appear to the entire world.  Please stop making a joke out of yourself.  Let people decide on their own to like or dislike the movie, and stop the communist way of "you do and think as I dictate".

i cannot believe Netflix wasted money on this turkey. Looks like a cartoon.

This looks pretty bad and fake. Not interested. It is by a Chinese company..?

It is a movie that has like 500 chinese cast (mostly extra is),  and 2 token white guys....and is somehow referred to as a "human epic". In contrast, even low budget apocalypse movies made by American is, have more asians in them than this movie has non-asians! The Chinese run and control the space station, the Chinese run and control all of the planet engines, yet the Chinese extra is are mostly seen just standing around or enjoying leisure. So who is doing all the work?  Who is growing the food?  Who is repairing things?  Certainly not the Chinese!  So when you really look at this movie, it is actually a disgusting movie about how China enslaves earth...only they do not show the slavery part because it would hurt the rose tinted propaganda.  But once you look at all the logistics of the movie, it becomes pretty clear that it is basically a "China rules the earth" type of movie.

This is fake. Earth is still completely fine. Do not believe these guys.
